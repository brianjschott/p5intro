# p5intro

### Lesson Goals: 
Students will be able to
+ Set up cloud 9 environment for processing
+ Animate shapes in 2 dimensions on a screen
+ Put images (and if time, sounds) into a sketch
+ Initiate variables and update variables in p5
+ Use if-statements in p5

### Hook
Show video from "The Office" (attached here or found at [this link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiX2ZTjwffUAhUGdT4KHbtvANQQuAIIKTAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.godtube.com%2Fwatch%2F%3Fv%3DJJBJFCNU&usg=AFQjCNFn-kQjAoiL0w_j0CRY40owbPUagA))

Transition: 
*"Animation is exciting.  Today, we are going to use p5 to re-create the animation from The Office"*

### Key "Beats" of the lesson
+ Set-up cloud 9 envirioment
+ Get image on the screen
+ Get the image to move in the x direction
+ Indentify why the movement isn't perfect... yet
+ Allow students to solve the movement problems AND add movement in the y direction
+ Encourage extensions, listed below
+ Debrief

#### Set-up cloud 9 enviroment
+ Show how to get the preview

#### Get image on the screen
+ 

#### Get image to move in x direction
+ Introduce variables by declaring a global variable dvdx
+ Encourage students to predict how you will use the variable to make the image move
+ Do a code along to show how you can make the image move in the x direction (make it clear that you are updating the dvdx variable to change the position)
+ Show that the loop re-draws the image leaving a "path" behind it, thus you need to clear the screen.

#### Indentify why the movement isn't perfect... yet
* Ask students *"What could we do to make this better?"*
  * Make the image bounce off the screen
  * Make the image so it bounced off both ends
  * Make the image so it bounces off the screen perfectly (not just off the screen)
  * Make the image move in the y direction too

+ Ask students to predict with a partner how they might get the image to bounce off the screen.
+ Gather student generated ideas and do a code-along to make the bounce happen.

+ Ask students *"What could we do to make this better?"*
++ Make the image so it bounced off both ends
++ Make the image so it bounces off the screen perfectly (not just off the screen)
++ Make the image move in the y direction too

#### Allow students to solve the movement problems AND add movement in the y direction
+ Monitor students and bring the class back together to share solutions and troubleshoot problems

#### Encourage extensions! 
+ Make it your own! 
++ Make it move at a different speed
++ Make your own image/shape 
++ Make it start in a random direction/location each time it starts
++ Change the code so when it hits the corner something happens (colors change, sound happens?)
++ Add in interactivity (make it when it bounces, it changes color, or when you click the screen the background changes color…)
++ … other
